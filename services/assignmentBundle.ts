/**
 * assignmentBundle.ts — the student loads one file, whatever it is called.
 *
 * ## The spec is found by what it IS, not by what it is called
 *
 * This loader used to look inside a zip for an entry **named**
 * `assignment_spec.json`. On 2026-09-06 the Assignment Maker began writing that
 * file as `{stem}_OPEN_IN_APP.json` and attaching one zip to Canvas holding the
 * PDF and the spec. A student who uploads the zip they were given — which is
 * the thing they were given — was told *"That zip has no assignment_spec.json
 * in it"* while holding exactly the right file.
 *
 * So an entry qualifies as the spec **structurally**: its text begins `gb1:`,
 * or it parses as a JSON object. No decryption is needed for that decision —
 * the prefix is a cheap test and the decode happens later, in `App.tsx`. A PDF
 * is binary and cannot qualify; a layout CSV starts with its header row and
 * cannot either.
 *
 *   - exactly one qualifying entry → that is the spec, under any name
 *   - more than one → refuse. Ambiguity must stay an error
 *   - none → refuse, and say what the zip did contain
 *
 * **There is no filename matching for the spec anywhere in this file, and none
 * may be added.** A rule keyed to a name is what caused this, the names have
 * already changed once, and a special case for `_OPEN_IN_APP.json` would be the
 * same defect wearing the next name along.
 *
 * The `layout_*.csv` lookup is still by name, deliberately and narrowly: the
 * work order left it unchanged, and "a separate CSV wins over the embedded map"
 * makes a false positive there worse than a miss — it would displace a correct
 * map with whatever else matched. **That is a known residual of the same
 * shape**, one file along: rename the CSV and this trap returns for the map.
 *
 * ## What still loads, unchanged
 *
 *     an old three-file zip     assignment_spec.json + layout_{ID}.csv + PDF
 *     a bare spec, any name     electronic assignments, and everything already
 *                               in circulation
 *
 * **Since 2026-09-06 a bare spec can be a COMPLETE handwritten assignment.**
 * The spec may carry the map inside it as `layoutCsv` / `layoutCsvName`, so the
 * student receives a sheet to print and one file to upload, with nothing to
 * open and no second file to choose wrongly. `chooseLayoutSource` decides
 * between the two, and a separate `layout_*.csv` still wins.
 *
 * A *handwritten* assignment with a map from neither place is refused by the
 * caller at load time: it can be photographed but never cropped, and a student
 * must not get sixteen pages in before finding that out.
 *
 * `jszip` was already a dependency (the submission package is a zip), so this
 * adds no bundle weight and no network surface.
