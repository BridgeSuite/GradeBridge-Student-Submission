/**
 * captureGate.ts — judge one photograph, at the moment it is taken.
 *
 * ## The policy
 *
 * > I am NOT interested in an app that attempts to correct or process bad
 * > images. A bad image will cause increasingly more problems, and a bad image
 * > is easy to correct upon intake. So, no need to take risk. Be conservative.
 * > — Andre, 2026-09-01
 *
 * The costs are asymmetric and the asymmetry is extreme. A **false accept**
 * propagates: a bad crop reaches the grader, the OCR reads nothing or reads
 * wrong, and the first person to find out is a student disputing a mark on work
 * they did correctly. A **false reject** costs two seconds and another
 * photograph.
 *
 * So this gate refuses rather than rescues, and **its strictness is what buys
 * the simplicity of everything downstream** — the crops, the OCR and the grader
 * are all allowed to assume clean input precisely because nothing else gets
 * through. That is why the escalating decode ladder was deleted rather than
 * tuned, and why there is no enhancement anywhere in this path: one
 * binarization, one parameter set, one pass.
 *
 * A false reject is still a defect. Being conservative is never licence to
 * reject a photograph a student should not have to take twice, and every
 * threshold below is placed against a measured worst case from the capture set
 * rather than chosen to look safe.
 *
 * ## Gate at capture time, not at submission time
 *
 * A page judged the moment it is photographed is reshot while the sheet is
 * still on the desk under the same light. A page judged after sixteen pages
 * have been taken and the papers put away is not a two-second fix, and at that
 * point the pressure to accept marginal input becomes overwhelming.
 *
 * ## What the checks are, and how they differ from the work order
 *
 * The work order specifies four checks in the order: whole sheet in frame,
 * sharpness, legibility, four marks. Three of those survive contact with the
 * sixteen captures unchanged in substance. The first does not, and the reason
 * is measured rather than argued — see `SHEET_IN_FRAME` below.

/**
 * ## SHEET_IN_FRAME — why there is no separate "whole sheet in frame" check
 *
 * The work order asks for one, ahead of everything else: locate the sheet the
 * QR sits on, and require all four of its corners to be inside the frame with a
 * margin. It is justified by `cap02` and `cap03`, and that justification is
 * sound — in both, the sheet runs out of the picture and only three corner
 * marks physically exist. It was built and measured, twice, and neither
 * measurement supports the check as specified.
 *
 * **Tracing the sheet by brightness does not work on these photographs.** The
 * outline was grown from the QR's quiet zone out to whatever was no longer
 * paper, bounded to a page and a third so a neighbour could not inflate it, and
 * measured as a multiple of the page's own known area at nine thresholds from
 * 0.40 to 0.85 of the paper's brightness beside the QR. There is no threshold
 * that traces the sheet. At every one of them `cap03` reads 3.8 to 4.3 pages —
 * it leaks across a bright background — while at the same settings `cap05` and
 * `stale03` collapse to 0.2 to 0.5 of a page, eaten by their own shading. The
 * populations overlap everywhere. The work order's own rule for that outcome is
 * explicit: the metric is wrong, find a better measurement, do not split the
 * difference.
 *
 * **The paper's corners are the wrong thing to measure anyway.** Given the
 * marks, the page's four corners are known exactly, so the check can be asked
 * of a real fit rather than a mask. Measured that way over all sixteen, the
 * page-corner inset from the frame edge is NEGATIVE on `cap04` (-9.0 mm),
 * `cap10` (-7.0 mm) and `stale03` (-3.7 mm) — three captures reviewed PASS,
 * which register at 0.54, 0.88 and 0.60 mm — and POSITIVE on `cap02`
 * (+20.3 mm), which is a FAIL. A check on paper corners rejects three good
 * photographs and admits a bad one. It is not that the threshold is wrong; the
 * quantity does not carry the distinction.
 *
 * What does carry it is the thing the work order's own justification names:
 * *"only three corner marks physically exist in the image."* A clipped page is
 * a **missing mark**, and a missing mark is what `CORNER_MARKS` tests. On the
 * sixteen, that check rejects `cap02` and `cap03` and no others — the exact
 * verdicts check 1 was asked for. So the two are one check here, and its
 * message names framing first, because framing is the likeliest cause and
 * "get the whole sheet in" is the action either way.
 *
 * The other half of check 1's job — bounding the mark search so a neighbouring
 * sheet cannot supply false fiducials — is done, but by geometry rather than by
 * an outline: every set of four is scored on whether it puts the decoded QR
 * where that QR actually is, so only the sheet the symbol is printed on can
 * win. `cap04` has three sheets in frame and registers at 0.54 mm.
 *
 * **This is a deviation from a written work order and it is flagged, not
 * buried.** If a sheet outline is wanted for its own sake, it needs a
 * measurement this capture set cannot give: an edge-based tracer, and
 * photographs that separate a cut-off page from a page whose blank corner is
 * merely cropped.

 * **This threshold is not calibrated, because the capture set contains nothing

 * justified in the work order by `cap09`, on the report that its decoder
 * *succeeded and returned an empty string* — which would have carried an empty
 * `layout_id` into the pipeline. At the resolution the app actually works in,
 * 2200 px on the long edge, that does not reproduce: `cap09` fails to decode at
 * all, which is the safe outcome, and it never reaches this check. Nor does
 * `cap08`. So the set holds no photograph that decodes and is then blurred.
 *
 * Measured over the fourteen that do decode, the metric runs 0.129 to 0.201 and
 * does not separate anything: `cap02` and `cap03` sit at 0.131 and 0.129 while
 * `stale04`, reviewed PASS, sits at 0.133. The floor is therefore placed below
 * the worst PASS with margin and nowhere near the others. It can catch a gross
 * case and is claimed to do nothing more.
 *
 * The hazard itself is real at other scales and is guarded elsewhere and
 * cheaply: `qrPayload.PAYLOAD_RE` means an empty or foreign string can never

/**
 * The fewest corner marks a fit may be built on.
 *
 * **Three, and the residual is what does the work.** This was four until
 * 2026-09-02, on the reasoning that a three-mark fit is affine, cannot
 * represent perspective, and is allowed a 3.0 mm budget in `registration.ts`
 * because a flagged page in front of a student to judge is better than nothing
 * — whereas this gate is what lets everything downstream assume clean input.
 *
 * That reasoning holds for the 3.0 mm budget and does not hold for the count.
 * The two real photographs that settle it are both three-mark fits from the
 * same phone: `ios2_01` finds NW, NE and SE and reprojects the QR to **0.61 mm**;
 * `ios2_05` finds NE, SW and SE and reprojects it to **42.33 mm**. Three marks is
 * sometimes excellent and sometimes catastrophic, and the residual already
 * tells the two apart by a factor of seventy. A count cannot: it rejects both.
 *
 * **The residual is trustworthy on three points because it is not measured
 * against them.** `registration.scoreFit` scores a fit by where it puts the
 * decoded QR, which the fit never consumed, so a three-point solve is not
 * self-satisfying here — an affine fit through three wrong points has nothing
 * pulling it towards the symbol, which is exactly what `ios2_05`'s 42 mm is.
 *
 * So a count of four was redundant with the residual check and stricter in the
 * wrong direction: it rejected a photograph that fits to 0.61 mm while adding
 * nothing to the rejection of one that fits to 42 mm. `ios2_01` is the first time
 * this gate told a real student to reshoot a photograph that was already
 * correct, and a threshold that rejects good work is a defect of the same
 * weight as one that accepts bad work.
 *
 * **What did NOT change, and is what keeps this safe.** The budget below three
 * is unchanged — two marks or fewer cannot be fitted and the caller routes the
 * student to direct capture. The gate's own residual budget stays at
 * `RESIDUAL_MAX_MM` (1.0 mm) for three-mark fits and four-mark fits alike, so
 * the 3.0 mm degraded budget in `registration.ts` never reaches a submission
 * through here. The geometry gate on the accepted set stays, so a set that does
 * not match the printed mark spacing is still refused outright. And the
 * QR-anchored scoring stays, which is both what makes the residual meaningful
 * on three points and what stops a neighbouring sheet supplying a mark.
 *
 * A page accepted on three is still recorded as such: `marksFound` is 3 and
 * `registration.status` is `degraded`, both of which reach the submission
 * manifest as `marks_found` and `registration`, so a grader looking at a
 * disputed crop can see the page registered on three.
