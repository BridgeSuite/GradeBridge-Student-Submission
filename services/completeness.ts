/**
 * completeness.ts — how many answers the assignment has, how many the archive
 * carries, and which ones are not in it.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * On 2026-09-04 a submission was built and downloaded with two photographs
 * missing, and nothing anywhere said a number. Three attempts to reproduce the
 * loss have failed and the cause is still unknown. **This does not fix the
 * cause. It removes the silence**, which is worth more, because it holds
 * whatever the trigger turns out to be — including triggers nobody has thought
 * of yet.
 *
 * ## The load-bearing decision: count from the MAP, never from the QR
 *
 * `layout_*.csv` is parsed the moment the assignment loads, before any
 * photograph exists, and it declares every region with its `part_id` and its
 * `page_k`. So the number of answers an assignment has is known from the first
 * screen and cannot stop being known.
 *
 * The page-level guard in `PageUploader` does the opposite: it reads `N` from
 * the QR on a photographed sheet, and its own comment says the count "is only
 * knowable once at least one page is in". **That is the failure mode. If
 * registration fails, `declaredN` is undefined, the missing-page list is empty,
 * and the warning disappears at exactly the moment it was needed.** A guard
 * against a thing that may be failing must not be derived from that thing.
 *
 * `maxPageK` is deliberately not used here either: it is the highest page
 * carrying a region, which on an assignment whose last sheet is blank is not
 * the page count.
 *
 * ## Presence is what the ARCHIVE holds, not what the record claims
 *
 * A region counts as answered when the built package actually carries its crop
 * entry. Not when a `CropRef` exists for it — `buildSubmissionPackage` skips a
 * crop whose bitmap `readBlob` cannot return, so a crop record with no bytes
 * behind it is precisely the 2026-09-04 shape: named in the payload, absent
 * from the ZIP, and until now silent.
 *
 * ## Inform, never block
 *
 * Nothing here refuses anything. A student submitting incomplete work on
 * purpose is a real and legitimate case, and `buildSubmissionPackage` packages
 * a partial submission without complaint by design. What this adds is that the
 * student sees the number and chooses it.

/**
 * What the gate puts in front of the student, or null when there is nothing
 * to say.
 *
 * **Structured rather than a single string, and that is the point.** This was
 * a `window.confirm` message until 2026-09-09. A suppressed `confirm` returns
 * `false` immediately without showing anything, the handler read `false` as
 * "cancel", and a student whose browser had begun ignoring dialogs could tap
 * Download and get nothing at all — for the life of the page, on the one path
 * where the failure is a zero rather than an annoyance. See the standing rule
 * in `CLAUDE.md`: **a guard on a constructive action must fail open.**
 *
 * So the choice is rendered in the page, where nothing can suppress it and
 * nothing can answer it on the student's behalf. Three things that bought:
 *
 *   - **No default-activated control.** In a `confirm`, OK is the default and
 *     Enter downloads an incomplete submission. The gate focuses its heading
 *     and nothing is one keystroke away.
 *   - **No cap on the list.** The dialog named six answers and said "and 8
 *     more" because a dialog nobody can read to the end is a dialog nobody
 *     reads. A panel scrolls, so all seventeen can simply be there.
 *   - **The prose stops naming browser buttons.** "choose OK" became "you can
 *     download anyway", which is true wherever it renders.
 *
 * **Null on a complete submission is a requirement, not an optimisation.** The
 * common path gets no gate, no congratulation and no extra tap.
