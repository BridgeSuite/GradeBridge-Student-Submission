 * answer to where the answer is; the printed box on the paper is redundancy for
 * a human eye, never an input here.
 *
 * **The 3 mm region pad is already baked into the stored rectangle. It is not
 * applied again.** Padding twice eats into the neighbouring part.

/**
 * ## `low-resolution` was retired on 2026-09-03, and it does not come back
 * ## without a photograph as its evidence
 *
 * It fired when a crop came in under 150 dpi. The OCR triage of 23 real crops
 * measured every one of its four firings and **all four were false** — each of
 * those crops read completely.
 *
 * The controlled pair settles it. `android09_p3_angle__p1b` at **118 dpi** and
 * `android10_p3_dim__p1b` at **194 dpi** are the same answer region on the same
 * sheet: same reading, same content, same two edges failing. **65% more linear
 * resolution changed nothing.** An independent hand comparison found the same,
 * one line cut at 195 dpi being indistinguishable from the same line at full
 * camera resolution.
 *
 * **Do not lower the threshold instead.** 118 dpi read cleanly, so this set
 * contains no evidence for any value, and choosing one would be the
 * split-the-difference this project has refused three times.
 *
 * Worse than useless on two of the four: the flag said the problem was image
 * quality when the actual problem was that the writer worked outside the box.
 * **A flag that misdescribes the defect sends the student to fix the wrong
 * thing** — they reshoot a page that was never the issue.
 *
 * `pxPerMm` below stays, on the region and in the submission manifest. The
 * number is real and useful; the threshold on it was not.
 *
 * If a capture is ever genuinely defeated by resolution, this comes back **with
 * that capture as its evidence** and not before.
