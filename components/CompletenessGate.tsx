/**
 * The gate that stands between an incomplete submission and its download.
 *
 * ## Why this is in the page and not a `window.confirm`
 *
 * It was a `confirm` until 2026-09-09. Browsers suppress repeated JavaScript
 * dialogs, and a suppressed `confirm()` **does not show a dialog, does not
 * wait, and returns `false`** — the HTML Standard says so normatively ("If we
 * cannot show simple dialogs for this, then return false"), MDN says "if a
 * browser is ignoring in-page dialogs, then the returned value is always
 * false", and WebKit's `confirmForBindings` returns false on every path that
 * declines to show one. The handler read that `false` as "the student
 * cancelled", so a student whose browser had begun ignoring dialogs could tap
 * Download and get **nothing at all**, permanently, with the only on-screen
 * text telling them to try again.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical for this app: `App.tsx` fires a confirm on every
 * page removal, and two back-to-back on the clear-work path. Nor does it need
 * the user to tick anything — Chrome suppresses `confirm()` outright in a
 * background tab, and a phone student who switches away while the package
 * builds is in a background tab.
 *
 * **The standing rule this now obeys is in `CLAUDE.md`: a guard on a
 * constructive action must fail open.** Downloading is constructive; a guard
 * over it that fails closed turns partial credit into a zero.
 *
 * ## Three things the gate buys beyond not being suppressible
 *
 *   - **Nothing is default-activated.** In a `confirm`, OK is the default
 *     button and Enter downloads an incomplete submission. Here the heading
 *     takes focus and neither control is one keystroke away.
 *   - **No cap on the list.** The dialog named six answers and said "and 8
 *     more"; a panel scrolls, so all seventeen are simply there.
 *   - **It works in an in-app WebView**, where dialog behaviour is its own
 *     unknown — see `services/inAppBrowser.ts`.
 *
 * ## It is a gate, not a banner, and that is deliberate
 *
 * A notice *beside* the Download button can be scrolled past. **Download
 * anyway lives inside this panel**, so the panel cannot be bypassed to reach
 * it. That is the whole reason the in-page route is safe where a banner would
 * not be.
 *
 * ## Continuing is a plain path, not a dark pattern
 *
 * A student handing in partial work on purpose is a real and legitimate case.
 * "Download anyway" is a full-size, plainly labelled button of the same weight
 * as the other, not a link hidden under the fold. What it is not is the
 * default: they have to mean it.
