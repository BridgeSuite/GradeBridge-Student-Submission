// On 2026-09-04 the app handed a student a submission with two photographs
// missing and never stated a number. The cause is still unknown after three
// attempts to reproduce it. This suite covers the guard that makes the loss
// visible whatever the cause is.
//
// **The check this suite exists for is check 1.** The count must be right with
// registration entirely absent — no page ever registered, so the QR-derived `N`
// the existing page-level guard reads is undefined and its missing-page list is
// empty. That is the case the old guard cannot handle and the reason the new
// one is derived from the layout map instead.
//
// What it does NOT cover: geometry, `layout_id`, the capture gate, encryption.
// `registration-tests.mjs`, `embedded-layout-tests.mjs`, `gate-tests.mjs` and
// `package-encryption-tests.mjs` hold those, and nothing here moves them.
