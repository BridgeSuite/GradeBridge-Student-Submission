// A student used to get a zip of three files and had to open it to reach the
// PDF, which put a spec and an editable geometry map in front of them and left
// them a file to choose wrongly. The spec can now carry the map inside it:
//
//     layoutCsvName   "layout_ENG17HOM496F.csv"
//     layoutCsv       the EXACT text of that file, newlines and all
//
// ## Why this suite exists, and what it is actually guarding
//
// `computeLayoutId` hashes `canonicalMapSerialization(rows)` — the rows
// `parseLayoutCsv` produced — and **not** the file's bytes. So embedding the
// same text and parsing it with the same parser gives identical rows by
// construction and the hash cannot move. That is an argument. §3 below is the
// measurement, over the real ENG17 Homework 1 map:
//
//     computedLayoutId  95438EDF from both routes
//     parsed rows       deeply equal
//     canonical form    byte-identical
//
// **95438EDF is printed into the QR code on every sheet of paper this project
// has produced**, including the whole capture set. Every other mistake in this
// change is a redeploy. That one is a reprint. Which is why the fixture is
// committed rather than reached for through an environment variable: this is
// the check in this repository that must never SKIP.
//
// Nothing here touches `canonicalMapSerialization`, `computeLayoutId`, `fmt4`
// or `parseLayoutCsv`, and nothing here may: `qrPayload.ts` says in its own
// header that those are byte-identical across both apps and must not be
// "improved". This suite reads them, it does not restate them.
