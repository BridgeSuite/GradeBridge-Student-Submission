// Plain Node (>= 18), no test framework, same shape as run-tests.mjs.
//
//   node tests/registration-tests.mjs      (also runs as part of `npm test`)
//
// Three groups, matching the three points the work order asks for a report at:
//
//   step 2 — the map arrives and a stale one is caught
//   step 3 — QR decode and mark detection over the capture set
//   step 4 — the transform, and what the crops land on
//
// The capture set here is synthetic (see captureSet.mjs) and **it is not the
// section 8 evidence**. The geometry is true; only the degradation is drawn.
// What it cannot produce is what actually breaks registration in the field, and
// the gap is not small: this detector once scored 12 of 12 on these synthetics
// and 4 of 11 on real photographs.
//
// The thresholds are no longer untuned — every one of them is now set from the
// sixteen photographs in tests/captures/real/ and stale/, and `gate-tests.mjs`
// holds them there. This file's job is the parts a photograph cannot check on
// its own: the ZIP path, the stale-map refusal, the crop geometry, and the
// 180-degree case that the real set happens not to contain.
