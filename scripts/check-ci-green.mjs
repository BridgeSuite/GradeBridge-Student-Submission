// =====================================================
// The deploy gate: refuse to publish a commit CI has not passed
// =====================================================
// On 2026-09-08 the decoder was deployed to production while `main` had been
// red for nearly twenty hours. Three failed runs had been delivered and were
// sitting unread in the GitHub inbox: **the signal existed, and it was not on
// the path between `git push` and `npm run deploy`.** Turning notifications on
// would not have helped, because they were already on; a fourth channel would
// not help either. This sits inside the one command that does the harm.
//
// The harm was never the red CI, which was recoverable. It was publishing a
// build that nothing had verified.
//
// **No credential is needed.** The repository is public and run conclusions are
// readable unauthenticated; only the LOGS endpoint returns 403. That
// distinction cost a cycle to learn, so it is written down here rather than
// rediscovered as "this needs a token".
//
// **A credential is USED when one is available, to raise the rate limit**
// (2026-09-25). Unauthenticated, GitHub allows 60 requests an hour per IP, and
// every deploy refusal in this project that was not a real red run was that
// budget running out, indistinguishable from a verdict at the moment it fires.
// Authenticated, it is 5,000. The token is looked for in this order, first hit
// wins: GITHUB_TOKEN, GH_TOKEN, then `gh auth token` if `gh` is on the PATH and
// logged in. Finding none is not an error: the gate runs exactly as it always
// has. Three rules, each held by a test:
//
//   - the token VALUE is never printed, logged or written; only its SOURCE is
//     named, and only when one was used;
//   - a token GitHub rejects (401) REFUSES, naming the token as the cause. It
//     never falls back to unauthenticated: that would hide a stale credential
//     and quietly restore the 60-an-hour limit this exists to remove;
//   - a rate-limit refusal says whether the request was authenticated, which
//     tells the operator whether the answer is "authenticate" or "wait".
//
// REFUSES on: a failed run, a cancelled run, no run at all, a run still in
// progress, and any error reaching the API. **A gate that opens when it cannot
// see is not a gate**, so a rate limit or a dropped connection refuses exactly
// like a red run does.
//
// "No run at all" is the case most likely to be dismissed as pedantry, and it
// is the one that matters most: ninety seconds after a push there is nothing to
// find, and a commit that was never pushed has no run and never will. **Silence
// is not success.**
//
// It refuses on all of those the same way. It does NOT report them the same
// way — see "three ways to see nothing" below, added 2026-09-09.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THREE WAYS TO SEE NOTHING, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME EVENT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This gate refuses on all of them. It must still SAY WHICH ONE it hit.
//
//   1. a well-formed empty result — the query was valid, the API answered it,
//      and there genuinely is no run. The commit is unpushed, or too new.
//   2. a malformed request — we asked a question the API cannot answer, and it
//      answered the question we actually asked. Nothing is wrong with the world.
//   3. a transport or API failure — we could not ask at all.
//
// **Collapsing these lets a typo impersonate a fact.** On 2026-09-09, while
// reconstructing state after a crash, this endpoint was queried by hand with an
// ABBREVIATED sha (`a57735d`). `head_sha` matches only the full 40 characters,
// so it returned `total_count: 0` — a well-formed answer to a malformed
// question. Read as case 1 that is "no CI run exists", the most serious thing
// this gate reports. Run #22 existed and was green throughout.
//
// Nobody was harmed — the operator noticed and re-queried. But an absence you
// manufactured yourself is the exact evidence someone cites to argue this gate
// is too brittle and should fail open, at which point the same typo publishes
// an unverified build and reports success. So:
//
//   - the REQUEST is validated before it is sent (case 2 cannot reach case 1);
//   - the RESPONSE is validated before it is read (a body of an unexpected
//     shape is not an empty list — `?? []` used to make it one);
//   - a real empty result SAYS it is real, so the next person debugs their
//     query only when the query is what is broken.
//
// See CLAUDE.md, "guards fail by the direction of the action and the recourse
// of the refused" — this gate fails CLOSED because its operator is at a
// terminal, is told why, and holds GB_ALLOW_RED_CI.
